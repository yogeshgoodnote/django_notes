views
Django views are Python functions that takes http requests and returns http response, like HTML documents.
A web page that uses Django is full of views with different tasks and missions.
Views are usually put in a file called views.py located on your app's folder.
There is a views.py in your myapp folder that looks like this: 
 
project1/myapp/views.py: 
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def myapp(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world!")
# Create your views here.

URLs
Create a file named urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file, and type this code in it:
Project1/myapp/urls.py:
"""
URL configuration for myproject project.

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from myproject import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('aboutus',views.hello)
]
